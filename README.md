# QPSK-QAM16-QAM64
modeling a simple QAM channel with AWGN
the program simulates QPSK QAM16 QAM64 modulations in a channel with AWGN
Main is a Python program that simulates transmission using QPSK, QAM-16, QAM-64.
The PNG file is a visualization of the program's operation.
The file called Tried on cpp is a C++ code that I tried to implement QPSK modulation.
